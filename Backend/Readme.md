# Courier Management System (CMS) - Backend 🚚

## 1. Project Description

The **Courier Management System (CMS)** is a production-grade RESTful backend application built with **Spring Boot 3.x** and **MongoDB**. It is designed to manage the end-to-end logistics lifecycle of courier operations, including secure user authentication, package booking, dynamic pricing, automated tracking, and role-based access control.

The system caters to three primary actors:

- **Customers**: Book shipments and track their journey.
- **Couriers**: Handle physical delivery and update shipment status.
- **Admins**: Oversight of the entire system, user management, and courier assignments.

Special emphasis is placed on security with **JWT-based authentication** and a **Secure OTP Handshake** for verified deliveries.

## 2. Core Pipelines & Workflows

### A. The End-to-End Delivery Pipeline

This flow describes the journey of a package from booking to the receiver's doorstep:

1.  **Booking (Customer)**: A customer creates a delivery request. The system generates a unique tracking number, calculates the price, and generates a **6-digit secure OTP**.
2.  **Assignment (Admin)**: An administrator reviews the created package and assigns it to an available Courier agent.
3.  **Transit (Courier)**: The agent picks up the package and moves it through various checkpoints (In Transit, Out for Delivery). Each status update is logged as an immutable tracking event.
4.  **Handshake Delivery (Courier + Customer)**: To complete the delivery, the courier must input the 6-digit OTP provided by the customer. This ensures the package is handed over to the right person.
5.  **Completion**: Upon successful OTP verification, the system marks the status as `DELIVERED` and logs the final timestamp.

### B. Secure Tracking Pipeline

Every status change in the system follows this automated path:

- **Trigger**: An API call is made to update a package status.
- **Event Creation**: A `TrackingEvent` is automatically created with the new status, timestamp, location, and remarks.
- **Public Access**: Public users can fetch this history using only the tracking number without needing to log in.

### C. OTP & Notification Pipeline

- **Generation**: Triggered during `POST /api/v1/packages`.
- **Notification**: The system sends an automated email (via Spring Mail) to the customer's registered email address.
- **Simulation Log**: Every outgoing communication is also logged in an internal `notifications` collection for demonstration/audit purposes.
